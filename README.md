# Crop-specific-weed-identification
A web-based system for weed identification and control recommendation using CNN. Users upload weed images to receive classification, detailed characteristics, and crop-specific control methods. Currently supports cotton crops and offers multilingual support for better accessibility.

Weed Identification and Control System is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers identify weeds through image uploads and provides control methods based on weed type and crop context. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system classifies weed species from uploaded images and returns relevant details including morphological characteristics and scientifically validated control methods. It currently focuses on weeds affecting cotton crops and supports multiple Indian languages—English, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Malayalam—to ensure accessibility for diverse users.

Key features include:

Image-Based Weed Detection using a trained CNN model

Crop-Specific Control Methods (initially for cotton)

Morphological Details of detected weed species

Multilingual Support for regional language accessibility

User-Friendly Interface designed for rural and low-tech users

The system avoids using a persistent database by operating dynamically on real-time user input and predictions. It’s developed using Python (Flask), HTML/CSS, and integrates machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras for classification tasks. This tool serves as a scalable solution to support precision agriculture and educate farmers with minimal technical dependency.
